Tasks Completed
Below is a summary of the tasks completed during this reporting period:

1. Project Setup
Description: Established the project infrastructure and configured development tools.
Details:
Initialized the frontend with React.js and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn components.
Set up the backend with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (with Redis for caching).
Configured version control using Git and GitHub.
Integrated package managers (npm, pnpm, Bun) for flexible dependency management.
Outcome: A robust project structure ready for feature development.
Duration: 1 day
2. Login
Description: Implemented JWT-based user login functionality.
Details:
Built a login UI with email and password inputs using React.js and Tailwind CSS.
Created a backend API endpoint (/api/v1/login) to authenticate users and issue JWT tokens.

Outcome: New users can create accounts and access the platform.
Duration: 1 day
4. Change Password
Description: Enabled users to update their passwords securely.
Details:
Created a password change UI accessible via a protected route.
Developed backend API (/api/v1/change-password) to update passwords in MongoDB.
Ensured JWT-based authentication for security.
Outcome: Authenticated users can modify their passwords.
Duration: 1 day
5. Reset Password
Description: Implemented the password reset functionality.
Details:
Built a "Reset Password" form to collect user emails.
Created backend endpoint (/api/v1/reset-password) to send a reset token via email (mock service for now).
Added a reset confirmation route to update the password.

Outcome: Users can set up and update their profiles as a basis for portfolio generation.
Duration: 2 days
Total Effort
Total Days Worked: 7.5 days
Key Milestones Achieved: Core authentication system and initial profile management completed, enabling secure user onboarding.
Challenges Faced
Redis Integration: Configuring Redis for caching profile data required additional setup time due to initial connection issues.
Resolution: Adjusted Redis configuration and tested caching locally.
UI Consistency: Ensuring Tailwind CSS and Shadcn components aligned seamlessly took extra effort for a cohesive look.
Resolution: Standardized component styles and created reusable utilities.
Next Steps (Planned for Upcoming Week)
Portfolio Selection: Implement the portfolio selection UI and backend logic to browse pre-built templates.
Portfolio Customization: Develop features for editing portfolio content and styles.
Deployment Options: Begin work on hosting portfolios on the platform and generating downloadable packages (Git, npm, pnpm, Bun).
Profile Synchronization: Start integrating automatic portfolio updates based on profile changes.
Testing: Write unit tests for authentication and profile endpoints.
Comments
The completed tasks provide a strong foundation for Gen Port, fulfilling key functional requirements like user authentication and profile management. The next phase will focus on the portfolio generation and deployment features, which are central to the platform’s mission of simplifying portfolio creation. Feedback from the team is appreciated to ensure we’re on track with the project’s vision of an open-source, user-friendly portfolio generator.
